<div class="css-full-post-content js-full-post-content">
  <p>This article describes how to set up a system for fast testing and package builds on a single machine using btrfs
  snapshots and chroot. There are tools around that perform similar tasks; even if you choose one of them, I hope this
  is still useful in demonstrating what those tools do under the covers.</p>

  <p>I've used this approach to test Puppet setups in LXC scheduled as a Jenkins job. These days, I'm using it to build
  packages for our monitoring agent with fpm (https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm). My team has to support an agent
  build on many Ubuntu LTS releases, 32-bit (old EC2 m1.small / c1.medium instances) and 64-bit architectures. The
  agent is written in Ruby - rather than trying to support mangled or ancient rubies, we're bundling our own copy of
  Ruby 1.9.3 with all the gems in the same package. We started with a single binary built on the lowest common
  denominator platform, but it wasn't ideal. When building across 6 installations ([hardy, lucid, precise] x [i386,
  x86_64]), running VM's for builds isn't really efficient. Using chroots and snapshots makes building the package
  consistently on one box a snap.</p>

  <h2>Requirements</h2>

  <ul>
    <li>a modern 64-bit Linux installation that has a build of debootstrap</li>

    <li>around 20GB of disk space</li>

    <li>btrfs-progs</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>System Configuration</h2>

  <p>If you're sitting on Mac OSX or Windows, you should fire up VirtualBox (or VMWare / Parallels / etc.) and install
  your favorite modern Linux distribution. Since I'm using debootstrap, using a Debian variant makes things a much
  easier. I've had luck building / installing debootstrap on other distros, but that's a lot of work that's out of
  scope for this article.</p>

  <p>Once Linux is installed, make sure you can sudo to root and have a chroot command available.</p>

  <h3>Install Packages</h3>

  <h4>Debian / Ubuntu</h4>

  <p>If you're using the newest version you want to build for, you can simply install deboostrap. Otherwise, you'll
  probably want to install a newer package than comes with the distribution. When I went to build Ubuntu 12.04 images
  from 10.04, I had to compromise and pull the precise script from the debootstrap tarball.</p>
  <pre>
<code>sudo apt-get install debootstrap<br /></code>
</pre>

  <p>This worked fine on my Ubuntu Lucid VM, YMMV:</p>
  <pre>
<code>wget http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/pool/main/d/debootstrap/debootstrap_1.0.40~precise1_all.deb<br />sudo dpkg -i debootstrap_1.0.40~precise1_all.deb<br /></code>
</pre>

  <h4>Gentoo / Funtoo</h4>
  <pre>
<code>sudo emerge -av dev-util/debootstrap<br /></code>
</pre>

  <h4>CentOS (and other RPM distros, adjust to taste):</h4>
  <pre>
<code>sudo rpm -ivh http://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/6/x86_64/epel-release-6-5.noarch.rpm<br />sudo yum install debootstrap # from EPEL<br /></code>
</pre>

  <h2>Disk Configuration</h2>

  <p>In this section, I'll describe 3 methods for setting up a volume to hold your btrfs filesystem.</p>

  <p>If your root disk is already using btrfs and you're comfortable experimenting on it, you can skip head to "create
  top-level subvolumes."</p>

  <h3>loopback</h3>

  <p>This is the lowest common denominator and also consumes the least space. I would not use this in production if
  avoidable, but it's fine for messing around.</p>
  <pre>
<code>sudo modprobe loop<br />device=$(losetup --find)<br />sudo truncate -s 20G snapfs.img<br />sudo losetup $device snapfs.img<br /></code>
</pre>

  <h3>LVM</h3>

  <p>Assuming you only have one volume group and maybe don't know what it was named (e.g. your distro created it).
  Adjust to taste if you're comfortable with LVM. This is what I'm using on my primary workstation for now.</p>
  <pre>
<code>vg=$(sudo vgdisplay |awk '/VG Name/{print $3}')<br />sudo lvcreate -L 20G -n lv_snapfs $vg<br />device="/dev/$vg/lv_snapfs"<br /></code>
</pre>

  <h3>Whole disks / Partitions</h3>

  <p>When I'm developing inside a VM, I often create an additional virtual disk to do things like this. Most of the
  GUI-ridden hypervisors will walk you through this. On a production system, it would be awful nice to use a fast RAID.
  In EC2, this would apply well to any of the non-root drive options like ephemeral disks or EBS volumes. The simplest,
  though not totally correct approach, is to mkfs the whole drive. This is how I've configured my VM on my machine at
  home.</p>
  <pre>
<code>drive="/dev/sdc"<br />device="${drive}1"<br />sudo sgdisk -Z $drive  # wipe any existing partition tables<br />sudo sgdisk -og $drive # create a new GPT label<br />sudo sgdisk -n 1:2048:0 -c 1:snapfs -t 1:8300 $drive # create one partition using the whole drive<br /></code>
</pre>

  <h2>Create &amp; Mount btrfs Filesystem</h2>
  <pre>
<code># where $drive is set by one of the commands above<br />sudo mkfs.btrfs -L snapfs $drive<br />sudo mkdir /snapfs<br />sudo mount $drive /snapfs<br /></code>
</pre>

  <h3>Create Top-level Subvolumes</h3>

  <p>These don't necessarily have to be subvolumes, but it seems like the right thing to do.</p>
  <pre>
<code>sudo btrfs subvolume create /snapfs/roots<br />sudo btrfs subvolume create /snapfs/snapshots<br /></code>
</pre>

  <h2>Create OS Roots</h2>

  <p>Now create your OS roots using debootstrap. febootstrap usage is probably similar but I haven't tried it. We're
  only going to do this once and use snapshots to effectively cache the OS root with fast copies. If you're messing
  around with this a lot, you might want to use a simple caching proxy to reduce bandwidth and speed up further
  downloads of the same packages.</p>
  <pre>
<code>sudo btrfs subvolume create /snapfs/roots/ubuntu-precise-amd64<br />sudo debootstrap --variant=buildd --arch x86_64 precise /snapfs/roots/ubuntu-precise-amd64 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/<br /></code>
</pre>

  <h3>Update</h3>

  <p>The sources.list installed by debootstrap only contains main. Before moving on, it's best to update it. Sometimes
  I'll take a snapshot before this step, but I feel that outdated images are not that useful. If your configuration
  managemen tools know how to configure roots other than /, you probably want to use whatever apt recipes you have for
  that instead.</p>
  <pre>
<code>cat &gt; /snapfs/roots/ubuntu-precise-amd64 &lt;&lt;EOF<br />deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise main restricted universe multiverse<br />deb http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-updates main restricted universe multiverse<br />deb http://security.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ precise-security main restricted universe multiverse<br />EOF<br /><br />sudo chroot /snapfs/roots/ubuntu-precise-amd64 apt-get update<br />sudo chroot /snapfs/roots/ubuntu-precise-amd64 apt-get dist-upgrade<br /># needed for simple scripting<br />sudo chroot /snapfs/roots/ubuntu-precise-amd64 apt-get install apt-utils lsb-release curl wget<br /></code>
</pre>

  <h3>Take a Snapshot</h3>

  <p>Right after creating the root, I usually take a snapshot in case I make a mistake later on. Snapshots aren't
  really different from subvolumes in treatment, so they're trivial to snapshot again back to
  /snapfs/roots/ubuntu-precise-amd64 if it gets messed up.</p>
  <pre>
<code>sudo btrfs subvolume snapshot /snapfs/roots/ubuntu-precise-amd64 /snapfs/snapshots/ubuntu-precise-amd64-debootstrap<br /></code>
</pre>

  <h3>Add Packages to Taste</h3>

  <p>Now is when you install your configuration management system and let it take over for a bit. It's also a good time
  to consider switching to nslite's nschroot or LXC to containerize its run so it can't affect as much of your host
  system.</p>

  <h4>Puppet</h4>

  <p>This is minimal. You might want to follow their instructions and import the puppet key. Obviously you'll want to
  import your puppet config, etc. as necessary.</p>
  <pre>
<code>echo "deb http://apt.puppetlabs.com/ubuntu precise main" &gt; /snapfs/roots/ubuntu-precise-amd64/etc/apt/sources.list.d/puppetlabs.list<br />sudo chroot /snapfs/roots/ubuntu-precise-amd64 apt-get install puppet-common puppet facter openssl<br /></code>
</pre>

  <h2>Building Ruby Packages</h2>

  <p>Debian and Ubuntu modify their Ruby packages and make them pretty difficult to use in some ways. They're also
  usually quite a ways behind current resulting in wide-spread use of tools like RVM and rbenv. Both of those tools
  tend to promote the practice of building machine code on edge machines, which some of us neckbeards think is a pretty
  bad idea. My preferred workaround is to build Ruby into packages that install into /opt/ruby/$version and are
  accessed by setting PATH, rbenv, or shebang modification.</p>

  <p>I prefer to set up most of the build environment in the "root" to save time and bandwidth on each build.</p>
  <pre>
<code>sudo chroot /snapfs/roots/ubuntu-precise-amd64 apt-get install build-essential gpgv libssl-dev zlib1g-dev git-core uuid-dev libreadline-dev pkg-config libffi-dev<br />cd /snapfs/roots/ubuntu-precise-amd64/tmp<br />git clone https://github.com/sstephenson/ruby-build.git<br />cd ruby-build<br />sudo bash install.sh<br /></code>
</pre>

  <p>Then, each time I build Ruby, I create a snapshot of the root so I can destroy it and any pollution
  afterwards.</p>
  <pre>
<code>sudo chroot /snapfs/roots/ubuntu-precise-amd64 /usr/local/bin/ruby-build 1.9.3-p194 /opt/ruby/1.9.3-p194<br /></code>
</pre>

  <h2>Building 32-bit Binaries From 64-bit Systems</h2>

  <p>util-linux has a utility called "setarch" that's really handy for building 32-bit binaries. True cross-build is a
  bit trickier, whereas setarch and its linux32 alias are quite easy and reliable. Simply prefix your commands with
  "linux32" and the environment will be mangled enough to trick most scripts into thinking they're running on i386
  systems. The Ruby configure script builds a cleaner RbConfig with this setup; other packages (like openssl) get
  totally confused without it.</p>
  <pre>
<code>sudo btrfs subvolume create /snapfs/roots/ubuntu-precise-i386<br />sudo debootstrap --variant=buildd --arch i386 precise /snapfs/roots/ubuntu-precise-i386 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/<br /># repeate further setup as above ... but prefix chroot as below if you like (it's not really necessary until you get to the builds)<br />sudo linux32 --uname-2.6 chroot /snapfs/roots/ubuntu-precise-i386 /usr/local/bin/ruby-build 1.9.3-p194 /opt/ruby/1.9.3-p194<br /></code>
</pre>

  <h2>nschroot</h2>

  <p>nschroot is a tiny utility I created to get most of the benefits of containers without all of LXC's statefulness
  and complexity. It's simple enough to build, just get the code from github (https://github.com/tobert/nslite) and run
  make. Then simply use "nschroot" instead of plain chroot and the new processes will run in a namespace.</p>
  <pre>
<code>sudo nschroot /snapfs/roots/ubuntu-precise-amd64 /bin/bash<br />&gt; mount none /proc -t proc<br />&gt; ps -ef<br /></code>
</pre>

  <p>Many applications don't need proc or sys so you don't need to mount them. Another simple trick is to write a shell
  script into the root and use it as init, just like in initramfs (a.k.a. initrd).</p>
  <pre>
<code>cat &gt; init.sh &lt;&lt; EOF<br />#!/bin/bash<br />mount none /proc -t proc<br />mount none /sys -t sysfs<br />mount none /tmp -t tmpfs<br /><br /># run some stuff<br />puppet --verbose --debug /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp<br /><br /># kill everything but $$, be really careful testing this!<br />for pid in $(ps -eo pid)<br />do<br />  if [ $pid -ne $$ -a -d /proc/$pid ] ; then<br />    kill -9 $pid<br />  fi<br />done<br /><br />umount /proc<br />umount /sys<br />umount /tmp<br />EOF<br /><br />sudo cp init.sh /snapfs/roots/ubuntu-precise-amd64/init.sh<br />sudo nschroot /snapfs/roots/ubuntu-precise-amd64 /bin/bash /init.sh<br /></code>
</pre>

  <h2>Testing With LXC</h2>

  <p>LXC is a set of tools on top of facilities that are standard in modern Linux kernels. Cgroups provides a solid
  resource limiting and tracking system, namespaces provide containers with private pids, ipc, and the like. It also
  hooks up capabilities to decrease security exposure. Many distributions require modification to run fully in LXC.
  There's also the lxc-exec option to run a single process in the container, but that requires lxc-exec inside the
  container.</p>

  <p>I haven't tested this bit in a while. Here's most of what was in my old scripts.</p>
  <pre>
<code>now=$(date +%s)<br />snapshot="/snapfs/snapshots/ubuntu-precise-amd64-test-${now}"<br />sudo btrfs subvolume snapshot /snapfs/roots/ubuntu-precise-amd64 $snapshot<br />sudo chroot $snapshot apt-get install lxc<br /><br />cat &gt; test-$now.conf &lt;&lt; EOF<br />lxc.utsname = puppet-test-${now}<br />lxc.rootfs = $snapshot<br />lxc.cgroup.cpuset.cpus = 0,1<br />lxc.cgroup.cpu.shares = 100<br />lxc.mount.entry=none proc    proc   nodev,noexec,nosuid 0 0<br />lxc.mount.entry=none dev/shm tmpfs  defaults 0 0<br />lxc.mount.entry=none dev/pts devpts defaults 0 0<br />lxc.cgroup.devices.deny = a<br />lxc.cgroup.devices.allow = c 1:3 rw  # null<br />lxc.cgroup.devices.allow = c 1:5 rw  # zero<br />lxc.cgroup.devices.allow = c 1:8 rwm # urandom<br />lxc.cgroup.devices.allow = c 1:9 rwm # random<br />lxc.cgroup.devices.allow = c 4:0 rwm # tty0<br />lxc.cgroup.devices.allow = c 4:1 rwm # tty1<br />lxc.cgroup.devices.allow = c 5:0 rwm # tty<br />lxc.cgroup.devices.allow = c 5:1 rwm # console<br />lxc.cgroup.devices.allow = c 5:2 rwm # pts/ptmx<br />lxc.cgroup.devices.allow = c 136:* rwm # pts/*<br />lxc.cap.drop = sys_boot sys_module sys_time<br />EOF<br /><br /># install puppet / chef / cfengine / whatever<br /><br /># if serverless, push your config code in<br /># if using a server, you probably want to copy pre-cached ssl/cfengine keys in to avoid<br /># spamming the server with ephemeral test keys<br /><br /># e.g. puppet masterless<br />sudo lxc-execute -f test-$now.conf -n puppet-test-$now -- puppet --verbose --debug /etc/puppet/manifests/site.pp<br /></code>
</pre>

  <h2>Other Approaches</h2>

  <p>I started out using all this stuff with Funtoo root &amp; child filesystems. With a little rpath and other linker
  tinkering you can use Funtoo/Gentoo to build packages with totally self-contained libc and everything.</p>

  <p>There are a number of other ways to do this. It looks like Debian uses dchroot / schroot to do almost exactly the
  same thing in their build system. This is the low-level way to do it and does not require much more than the standard
  OS tools + btrfsprogs once the initial setup is complete.</p>

  <p>With a little adjustment, a similar procedure will work with ZFS (http://zfsonlinux.org/) or even LVM snapshots
  (but those can be slow). I've even used git branches to do the same thing, but they get slow quite quickly with the
  amount of data required.</p>

  <p>At some point, I might give multistrap (http://wiki.debian.org/Multistrap) a try.</p>

  <p>I have experimented with using unionfs. This works great for testing in chroots and LXC on normal filesystems.
  Another advantage is that you can inspect the COW area to see the files and content that changed relative to the
  source image. Accounting and managing mounts is more tedious, but for some people it may be a superior base to build
  on.</p>
