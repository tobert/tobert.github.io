  I hacked <a href="http://www.goof.com/pcg/marc/root-tail.html">root-tail</a> to work with Nautilus, KDE, and
  hopefully XFCE4's xfdesktop. I took the toon_root.c file from <a href="http://xpenguins.seul.org/">xpenguins</a> and
  :r'd it into root-tail.c. A few modifications later and I had a working root-tail for nautilus.<br />
  <br />
  Download the tarball: <a href="/files/unix/root-tail-xpenguins.tar.gz">root-tail-xpenguins.tar.gz</a> or just
  <a href="/files/unix/root-tail.c">root-tail.c</a>. Here it is in HTML:
