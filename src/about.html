<p>I am a parent, systems engineer, musician, and more.
<br/><br/>
While attending <a href="http://cmich.edu">university</a> as a music major, I got into <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD">MUD</a>s. I played <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Realms_of_despair">Realms of Despair</a> for about a year before I realized I really wanted to hack on them. I had done a little BASIC on Apple IIe in middle school, so I figured "how hard could it be?"
<br/><br/>
Since all I had at the time was a 486 running Windows 95, my first experience with C was via Cygwin. Someone recommended
that I pick up a copy of Slackware Unleashed from the student bookstore and give it try. I did. A couple months later
I emerged from my apartment with early signs of neckbeard and headed off to Detroit to start my career as a
Junior Systems Administrator. Many things have changed since then.
<br/><br/>
Over the 25 or so years of my career, I have worked on everything from hacking Linux kernel drivers to
<a href="https://github.com/tobert/f7u12">HTML5 games</a>, <a
	href="https://github.com/tobert/halfremembered-models">inference services</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/tobert/sshwarma">rust MCP things</a>
